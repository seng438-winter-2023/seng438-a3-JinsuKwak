# 1 Introduction

Text…

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Text…

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Advantages of Requirements-Based Test Generation

-Ensures that requirements have been covered and tested



Disadvantages of Requirements-Based Test Generation

-Does not ensure that the code has been tested



Advantages of Coverage-Based Test Generation

-Ensures that the code has been tested

-Gives a measurement of how much unit testing has been done 



Disadvantages of Coverage-Based Test Generation

-Does not test if the code has been developed according to the requirements (just that the code works properly)

-100% coverage does not guarantee the effectiveness of a test suite
